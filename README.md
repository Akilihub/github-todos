# Github App that creates issue's out of TODO and FIXME comments

The app basically searches through a repo's source code and looks for occurrences of key words such as TODO and FIXME.

On finding these key words it creates a github issue titled <KeyWord> with file name. eg `TODOs from main.ts`

The issues in that file are turned into a check list containing issue description with issue author (git committer).


## Setup

```sh
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the bot
npm run start
```
